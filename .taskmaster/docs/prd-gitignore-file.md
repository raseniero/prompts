# PRD: Comprehensive .gitignore File

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for this prompt engineering project. The primary goal is to prevent sensitive information, temporary files, operating system-specific files, and build artifacts from being committed to the Git repository. This ensures the repository remains clean, secure, and lightweight.

## 2. Goals

*   Exclude all sensitive files and API keys from version control.
*   Prevent macOS-specific system files from cluttering the repository.
*   Ignore dependency directories and build outputs to keep the repository small.
*   Exclude common log and temporary files generated during development.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a developer,** I want to prevent secret files (like `.env` or `mcp.json`) from being committed so that I don't expose sensitive credentials.
*   **As a developer working on macOS,** I want to automatically ignore system-generated files (like `.DS_Store`) so the repository remains clean for all collaborators, regardless of their OS.
*   **As a developer,** I want to ignore dependency folders (like `node_modules`) and build outputs so that cloning the repository is fast and only source code is tracked.

## 4. Functional Requirements

The `.gitignore` file must be configured to ignore the following files and directories:

1.  **Sensitive Files:**
    *   `.env`
    *   `.env.*` (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.development`)
    *   `mcp.json`
2.  **macOS System Files:**
    *   `.DS_Store`
    *   `._*`
    *   `.Spotlight-V100`
    *   `.Trashes`
3.  **Dependency Directories:**
    *   `node_modules/`
    *   `__pycache__/`
4.  **Build & Compilation Outputs:**
    *   `build/`
    *   `dist/`
    *   `*.pyc`
5.  **Log & Temporary Files:**
    *   `*.log`
    *   `*.tmp`
    *   `*.swp`

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This task does not include setting up Git hooks or other repository configurations.
*   This `.gitignore` will not remove files that have already been tracked by Git. It only prevents untracked files from being added.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   After the `.gitignore` file is created and committed, running `git status` in the project root will not show any of the files or patterns listed in the "Functional Requirements" section as untracked.
*   Creating a new file, such as `test.log` or `.env`, in the project directory will not cause it to appear in the output of `git status`.

## 7. Open Questions

*   None at this time. 

## 8. Implementation Prerequisites

*   **Create Feature Branch**: Before writing any code, create a new feature branch from the `main` branch. A suggested name is `feature/setup-gitignore`.
