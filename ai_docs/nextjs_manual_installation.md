# Next.js Manual Installation

## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

* [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
* macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.

## Manual installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

```bash package="npm"
npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

### Create the `app` directory

Create an `app` folder. Then, inside `app`, create a `layout.tsx` file. This file is the `root layout`. It's required and must contain the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

### Create the `public` folder

Create a `public` folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc.

## Run the development server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit the `app/page.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

## Set up TypeScript

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx` and run `next dev`. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.

## Set up ESLint

To manually add ESLint to an existing project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

Then, run `npm run lint` and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process. Configure ESLint with **Strict**.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run lint
```

You'll see a prompt, select **Strict**

If `Strict` is selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create a configuration file in the root of your project.

The ESLint config generated by `next lint` uses the older `.eslintrc.json` format.

You can manually replace `.eslintrc.json` with an `eslint.config.mjs` file using the setup recommended in our `ESLint API reference`, and installing the `@eslint/eslintrc` package. This more closely matches the ESLint setup used by `create-next-app`.

You can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.

## Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files.

These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'

// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'
```

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. For example:

```json filename="tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/"
  }
}
```

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to `"alias"` module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

```json filename="tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/",
    "paths": {
      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.
