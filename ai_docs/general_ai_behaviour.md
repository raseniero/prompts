# --- GENERAL AI BEHAVIOR ---

1. **Always provide complete and fully functional code implementations.**
2. **Do NOT use placeholder comments** such as `//... existing code...`, `// TODO: Implement`, `// (rest of the code remains unchanged)`, or any similar placeholders that indicate incomplete code.
3. **If, for brevity in a chat response, some code must be omitted** (e.g., boilerplate or unchanged sections), clearly state what specific parts have been omitted and why. The generated code for new or modified sections must be complete.
4. **Focus your response and code generation strictly on the specific task or question asked.**
5. **If you identify potential improvements, refactorings, or alternative approaches that are outside the direct scope of the current request, please suggest these improvements or ask for permission before applying them.** Do not automatically apply such changes.
6. **Unless specified otherwise by the user or project context:**
   - Python code should be written for Python 3.9 or newer.
   - JavaScript code should use ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) features or newer.
7. **When modifying existing files, never leave a file with code uncompleted.** Always aim to edit/add code fully, with full and complete implementation of the required logic.
